_tensevntysevn services_ will undergo maintenance on **May 7, 2021**, starting **10:00AM Philippine Standard Time**.

Select services will be disrupted during the maintenance period. 

**Disrupted services will include:**

* Fresh Hub (Feedback and OMC request)
* Over-the-Air (OTA) update services, **including addons**.
* The Fresh website ([https://fresh.tensevntysevn.cf/](https://fresh.tensevntysevn.cf/ "https://fresh.tensevntysevn.cf/"))

Services will be moved to a new provider that should allow access to more ISPs, if possible.

Maintenance will take **3-6 hours** from time of start due to change in DNS, although services will continue to be online (albeit disrupted).

I apologize for the inconvenience.
