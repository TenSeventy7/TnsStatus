Started 3 hours earlier than expected, server maintenance has been finished and **all services are now back up**. All services have been moved to CloudFlare which may ensure better access to select territories, as well as faster performance.

It may take a while before your ISP redirects all requests through CloudFlare but it will take less than a day.

A future Fresh and Fresh Hub update will also add a secondary mirror for the update APIs, in the case of ISPs blocking websites domain-level.

Again, I apologize for the inconvenience.
